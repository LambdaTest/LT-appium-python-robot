*Robot Framework is a flexible, open-source test automation tool that can be used for acceptance testing and acceptance test-driven development. It's a keyword-driven testing framework that uses tabular test data syntax.  Perform [JUnit test on LambdaTest's online cloud](https://www.lambdatest.com/appium-mobile-testing?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repo&utm_campaign=LT-appium-python-robot).*

*Learn the basics of [Appium testing on the LambdaTest platform](https://www.lambdatest.com/support/docs/getting-started-with-appium-testing/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repo&utm_campaign=LT-appium-python-robot).*

* [Executing The Tests](#executing-the-tests)

## Pre-requisites

Before you can start performing App automation testing with Appium, you would need to follow these steps:

- Install the latest stable Python build from the [official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
- Make sure **pip** is installed in your system. You can install **pip** from [here](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/).

### Clone The Sample Project

Clone the LambdaTest’s :link: [LT-appium-python-robot](https://github.com/LambdaTest/LT-appium-python-robot) repository and navigate to the code directory as shown below:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/LambdaTest/LT-appium-python-robot
cd LT-appium-python-robot
```

### Setting Up Your Authentication

Make sure you have your LambdaTest credentials with you to run test automation scripts on LambdaTest. To obtain your access credentials, [purchase a plan](https://billing.lambdatest.com/billing/plans?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repo&utm_campaign=LT-appium-python-robot) or access the [Automation Dashboard](https://appautomation.lambdatest.com/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repo&utm_campaign=LT-appium-python-robot).

Replace LambdaTest `username` and `accesskey` in the `common.robot` file as mentioned below:

```bash title="common.robot"
*** Settings ***
Library  AppiumLibrary

*** Variables ***
// highlight-start
${username}         username
${accesskey}        accesskey
// highlight-end
${REMOTE_URL}       https://${username}:${accesskey}@mobile-hub.lambdatest.com/wd/hub
${TIMEOUT}          3000

*** Keywords ***
Open test app
    Open Application  ${REMOTE_URL}  platformName=${platform}  platformVersion=${version}  deviceName=${deviceName}  visual=${visual}  network=${network}  isRealMobile=${isRealMobile}   app=${app}   name=Robot Framework Sample Test    build=Appium Python Robot

Close test app
    Close Application
```

### Upload Your Application

Upload your **_iOS_** application (.ipa file) or **_android_** application (.apk file) to the LambdaTest servers using our **REST API**. You need to provide your **Username** and **AccessKey** in the format `Username:AccessKey` in the **cURL** command for authentication. Make sure to add the path of the **appFile** in the cURL request. Here is an example cURL request to upload your app using our REST API:

**Using App File:**

**For Linux/macOS:**

```js
curl -u "YOUR_LAMBDATEST_USERNAME:YOUR_LAMBDATEST_ACCESS_KEY" \
--location --request POST 'https://manual-api.lambdatest.com/app/upload/realDevice' \
--form 'name="Android_App"' \
--form 'appFile=@"/Users/macuser/Downloads/proverbial_android.apk"' 
```

**For Windows:**

```js
curl -u "YOUR_LAMBDATEST_USERNAME:YOUR_LAMBDATEST_ACCESS_KEY" -X POST "https://manual-api.lambdatest.com/app/upload/realDevice" -F "appFile=@"/Users/macuser/Downloads/proverbial_android.apk""
```

**Using App URL:**

**For Linux/macOS:**

```js
curl -u "YOUR_LAMBDATEST_USERNAME:YOUR_LAMBDATEST_ACCESS_KEY" \
--location --request POST 'https://manual-api.lambdatest.com/app/upload/realDevice' \
--form 'name="Android_App"' \
--form 'url="https://prod-mobile-artefacts.lambdatest.com/assets/docs/proverbial_android.apk"'
```

**For Windows:**

```js
curl -u "YOUR_LAMBDATEST_USERNAME:YOUR_LAMBDATEST_ACCESS_KEY" -X POST "https://manual-api.lambdatest.com/app/upload/realDevice" -d "{"url":"https://prod-mobile-artefacts.lambdatest.com/assets/docs/proverbial_android.apk","name":"sample.apk"}"
```

**Tip:**

- If you do not have any **.apk** or **.ipa** file, you can run your sample tests on LambdaTest by using our sample :link: [Android app](https://prod-mobile-artefacts.lambdatest.com/assets/docs/proverbial_android.apk) or sample :link: [iOS app](https://prod-mobile-artefacts.lambdatest.com/assets/docs/proverbial_ios.ipa).
- Response of above cURL will be a **JSON** object containing the `App URL` of the format - <lt://APP123456789123456789> and will be used in the next step.

## Run Your First Test

Once you are done with the above-mentioned steps, you can initiate your first Robot test on LambdaTest.

**Test Scenario:** Check out [Android.robot](https://github.com/LambdaTest/LT-appium-python-robot/blob/master/Tests/Android.robot) file to view the sample test script for android and [iOS.java](https://github.com/LambdaTest/LT-appium-python-robot/blob/master/Tests/IOS.robot) for iOS.

### Configuring Your Test Capabilities

You need to update your capabilities in `Makefile` files. In this sample project, we have provided the examples for running tests on both **Android** and **iOS** apps. We are passing platform name, platform version, device name and app url (generated earlier) along with other capabilities like build name and test name via capabilities object. The capabilities object in the sample code for a single test are defined as:

```bash title="Makefile"
test_Android1:
	robot --variable version:10 --variable platform:Android --variable deviceName:"Galaxy S20" --variable isRealMobile:true --variable visual:true --variable network:false --variable console:false --variable app:"lt://" Tests/Android.robot

test_iOS1:
	robot --variable version:14 --variable platform:iOS --variable deviceName:"iPhone 11" --variable isRealMobile:true --variable visual:true --variable network:false --variable console:false --variable app:"lt://" Tests/IOS.robot
```

**Info Note:**

- You must add the generated **APP_URL** to the `"app"` capability in the config file.
- You can generate capabilities for your test requirements with the help of our inbuilt :link: **[Capabilities Generator tool](https://www.lambdatest.com/capabilities-generator/beta/index.html?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repo&utm_campaign=LT-appium-python-robot)**. A more Detailed Capability Guide is available [here :page_facing_up:](https://www.lambdatest.com/support/docs/desired-capabilities-in-appium/?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repo&utm_campaign=LT-appium-python-robot) .

## Executing The Tests

Run the following command in the directory to install the relevant dependencies.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Execute the following command to run your test on LambdaTest platform:

<Tabs className="docs__val">

<TabItem value="ios" label="iOS" default>

```bash
make test_iOS1
```

</TabItem>

<TabItem value="android" label="Android" default>

```bash
make test_Android1
```

</TabItem>

</Tabs>

**Info:** Your test results would be displayed on the test console (or command-line interface if you are using terminal/cmd) and on the :link: [LambdaTest App Automation Dashboard](https://appautomation.lambdatest.com/build?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repo&utm_campaign=LT-appium-python-robot).
